# Empty Joomla! Component
An empty component designed for pages which are showing modules only, save resources by not dispatching a component!

## Requirements
- The latest version of Joomla!
    - NOTE: Conceivably this component could work on all Joomla! versions that include the `JControllerLegacy` and `JViewLegacy` classes however it is only developed and tested against the current version.
